journalText = "To whoever it may concern, By reading this note, you have just won the rights to my latest invention, the Fully Intelligent Literary Extraction Servitor! It’s a little bit in disrepair, but I’ve left my latest AI assistant in it. Hopefully it’s been dormant, or else it might have become a little strange from all that isolation. If you have any computing device near you, the robot should have transmitted my current work so far. It should be mostly completed; I’ve been working tirelessly to adjust everything so that its perfect. I’ve left it in a folder called “data” that generated when you opened the program. It should be in the same folder that this game’s files are in. My assistant should have left some extra information inside a few README files. Best Wishes, Dr. Prahn";
