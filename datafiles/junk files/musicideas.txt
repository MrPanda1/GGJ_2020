Ideas for boss music
Theory:
I think ideally in these repeated music phrases while there should be some semblance of
conflict and resolution it should never resolve fully. Don't hit 'em with that long tonic chord.
Diminished sevenths has great conflict.
Some chord progressions (i°=i diminished, ♭v=flat five)
i-V-VI-V
i-VI-III-VII
i-VI-III-V7
VI-III-V7-V7
VI-VII-v-V7
i-ii°-i-iv°7-i-vii°-i-V7
i-V7-♭v°-i
i-#vii7-vii7-i
Chords that are out of key or don't make sense can be very unsettling.
Suddenly and temporarily changing the time signature can also have a strong effect.

Instruments:
From the fantasy theme orchestral instruments make a lot of sense
Here's my thoughts on a lot of instruments
Strings: good everywhere as melody or chords.
Brass: Would work well in boss themes for bass, or melodic for a heroic/military feel.
Piano: Not typically associated with anything evil, but still could be with enough melodic focus.
Organ: Situational use in this fantasy/boss theme. I personally associate it with a more "noble" evil.
Woodwinds: It'll fill out that higher register, but I rarely give these any important role.
Drums: Definitely useful, it would be great if someone could find some good orchestral drums.
Electronic/other: I'm sure one could manipulate sin/triangle/whatever waves to combine with
the rest of your instruments.

Due to the "simple" nature of this game, I don't think the music should be too heavy.
What I mean by that is while the ideas can be complex, it would probably fit best
if there were only a few instruments playing at the same time at any given moment.

In conclusion, do whatever you want and hope it sounds good.
