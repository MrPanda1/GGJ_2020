I simply used the ls command to see all the files in level 0 and then once I found the readme I just used cat to be able to see its contents.

Level1
Very similar to level 0, I sued ls to see the files in level 1 and once I found the – file I simply used cat with quotes so the terminal wouldn’t think it was a command.

In level three the only file in the first part is a folder so I simply used cd to enter it then used ls -a to see all the files even hidden ones and then once I found the .inhere file used cat again with quotation marks to see its contents.

For level 5 I used cd to open the inhere folder and once I was there and saw all the other folders I decided to use find with -size to find the file with a size of 1033 bytes, after that I used cat with the directory path to see the contents inside.

Level6
For level 6 since the instructions said that it was somewhere in the server I decided to go to the first folder of the serve,  to do that I used cd .. twice, and once I was there I used find with -user -group and -size to find all the files matching the description, after that I simply looked for the one that didn’t give me an access denied message, copied its path and then used cat to see its contents.
