Muffins

INGREDIENTS

1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
½ cup sugar
2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
¾ teaspoon salt
1 beaten egg
¾ cup milk
⅓ cup cooking oil

DIRECTIONS

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.

In a separate bowl combine the egg, milk, and oil. Then add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients all at once. Stir just until moistened.

Grease or paper line a muffin pan. Fill each pan cup to ⅔ full.

Bake for 18-20 minutes.



*If the mix seems a little too thick, add a bit more milk.
