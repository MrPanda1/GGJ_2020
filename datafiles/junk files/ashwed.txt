 Glitt'ring balls and thoughtless revels
        Fill up now each misspent night -
    'Tis the reign of pride and folly,
        The Carnival is at its height.
    Every thought for siren pleasure,
        And its sinful, feverish mirth;
    Who can find one moment's leisure
        For aught else save things of earth?

    But, see, sudden stillness falling
        O'er those revels, late so loud,
    And a hush comes quickly over
        All the maddened giddy crowd,
    For a voice from out our churches
        Has proclaimed in words that burn:
    "Only dust art thou, proud mortal,
        And to dust shall thou return!"

    And, behold, Religion scatters
        Dust and ashes on each brow;
    Thus replacing gem and flower
        With that lowly symbol now:
    On the forehead fair of beauty,
        And on manhood's front of pride,
    Rich and poor and spirit weary -
        All receive it, side by side.

    And the hearts that throbbed so wildly
        For vain pleasure's dreams alone,
    For its gilded gauds and follies,
        Now at length have calmer grown.
    Oh! that voice with heavenly power
        Through each restless breast hath thrilled,
    And our churches, late so lonely,
        Now with contrite hearts are filled.

    Fair and lovely are our altars
        With their starry tapers bright,
    With dim clouds of fragrant incense,
        Fair young choristers in white,
    And the dying gleam of day-light,
        With its blushing crimson glow,
    Streaming through the lofty casement
        On the kneeling crowd below.

    Tis an hour of golden promise
        For the hearts that secret burn
    With contrite and anxious wishes
        To the Father to return;
    For a Saviour, full of mercy,
        On His altar-throne is there,
    Waiting but that they should ask Him,
        For response to whispered prayer.
