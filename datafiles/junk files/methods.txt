I brute forced it by creating a method that would simply turn the cipher in base 64 to plain cipher text and then run the encrypt method with a loop of 128 (or 2 to the 7th the max value of java bytes) to turn it into supposed readable text. Then after the string was turned into supposed readable text check if the string “the ” was ever present and if it was then print it along with the key used. After that I would just have to check the outputted text. It looks like the quote came from the book C, Julius Caesar, gallic war, book 3.

Thus at the same time, Sabinus was informed of the naval battle and Caesar of victory gained by Sabinus; and all the states immediately surrendered themselves to Titurius: for as the temper of the Gauls is impetuous and ready to undertake wars, so their mind is weak, and by no means resolute in enduring calamities.

XX.â€”About the same time, P. Crassus, when he had arrived in Aquitania (which, as has been before said, both from its extent of territory and the great number of its people, is to be reckoned a third part of Gaul), understanding that he was to wage war in these parts, where a few years before L.
