Snowman Valley:
C46-DKR-XNF
A simple and easy Snow level featuring sliding down slopes, ice you have to break through, and a couple tricky jumps. There are 2 secret areas to find and 1 secret block.

Super Smash Bros. Maker:
HH9-RMX-NWF
Fight Mario series reps on SSB-inspired stages like NSMBU, Peach's Castle 64, Delfino Plaza, and Final Destination! This level counts on you being able to survive for a few seconds before the items you need show up.

Super Mario Land W1-1:
W7L-5LN-M1H
Exactly what it says, a pretty close remake of the first level from Super Mario Land. Just wanted to introduce some nostalgia since they added the Super Ball item.
