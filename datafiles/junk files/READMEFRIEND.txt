FINAL ASCENT

If you're reading this, I hope you're having/had a wonderful day.

I'm in a deadly state of tired while writing this. Here's the gm48
description copied and pasted:

----

	You either die or you win. Whichever comes first is your final result. You only got One Shot.

	This game is quite hard, but I hope people are slick enough to get at least 4 or 5 levels in (out of 9) 
	before their untimely demise. If you actually win on your first go then color me surprised, I'll buy you 
	a pizza or something.

	Obviously if you delete the right file then you can play again. This defeats the purpose though, and I 
	suggest rating after you're done with your first run. Rate however you choose.

	Didn't end up making a proper death animation! Woops!

	A non-permadeath version will be out after the jam probably.
	
	----

	Controls:

	Arrow Keys - Movement

	Up, Spacebar, or Z - Jump

	Down - Interact or progress text

	As always, thank you for playing. I need sleep...

I wrote that one tired, too.

Follow me on twitter @seltzyy and look me up on itch.io because i told u to.

The game saves in your %localappdata% folder. If you wanna play again just delete the file called "1sd" in the
FinalAscent folder.

Pce.
