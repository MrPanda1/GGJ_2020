What is pious is loved because it is pious.
Not all things we love is pious.
What is god-loved is loved by the gods, not loved because it's god-loved.
We do not love all things god-loved.

In one of Socrates attempts to define piety he tries to disprove the claim that
the god-loved is the same as the pious. First, the pious is defined as what is pious
is loved because it is pious, not because it is being loves. One can gather from this
that not everything we love is pious. To visualize it, imagine a circle that contains all
thing pious. Then imagine a larger circle encompassing that smaller circle. This larger
circle is things we love. As you can (hopefully) see, we love all things pious, but not
everything we love is pious. Secondly, the god-loved is defined as what is god-loved is 
loved by the gods, and is not loved because it is god-loved. Thus, we do not love all
things god-loved. If the god-loved and pious are the same, there exists a contradiction. 
If this were true, and the god-loved was the same as the pious, then the previous example
showing the circles would be wrong. After disproving the statement Socrates asks Euthyphro
again to define what the pious and impious are.
