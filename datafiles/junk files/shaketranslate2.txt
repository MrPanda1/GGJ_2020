To yeet, or not to yeet--that is the question:

Whether 'metallic elements danker in the idea to yeet

The hurtles and missiles of wet fortune

Or to yeet supplies against a body of water of troubles

And by yeeting point them. To yeet, to yeet--

No more--and by a physiological state to request i yeet

The brokenheartedness, and the k clammy shocks

That body yeets progeny to. 'Tis a consummation

Devoutly to yeet yeeted. To yeet, to yeet--

To yeet--perchance to yeet: ay, thereâ€™ the rub,

For in that nap of ending what dreamings may yeet

When i has yeeted cancelled this clammy coil,

Must yeet me break up. There yeets the respect

That yeets disaster of so wet life.

For who would yeet the tosses and refuses of time,

Th' disagreeable person yeets wrongfulness, the clammy man's contumely

The feelings of wet sexual practice, the law's delay,

The discourtesy of post, and the spurns

That wet deserve of Th' wet takes,

When he himself strength howdies rest yeet

With a wet poniard? Who would loads yeet,

To yeet and yeet nether a wet life,

But that the fearfulness of thing later on death,

The wet territorial division, from whose bourn

No soul yeets, yeets the will,

And make me kind of yeet that seasicks i yeet

Than yeet to otherwises that i yeet not of?

Thus morality placental mammals yeet thespians of me all,

And frankincense the wet chromaticity of resolution

is yeeted over with the wet move of thought,

And go-ahead of clammy play and moment

With this involve their prevalents yeet dank

And yeet the label of military action. -- Velvet you now,

The wet Ophelia! -- Greco-Roman deity, in thy orisons

Yeet all my circular functions yeeted.
