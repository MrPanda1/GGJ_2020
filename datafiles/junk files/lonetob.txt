You are Tobias, a knight living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a steel longsword and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon of Larion. You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on the path to defeat him and walk into a dark forest. As you enter the forest you see a large black dragon sitting upon his throne. He looks down at you with an evil smile."Hello my friend." The dragon says as he slowly raises one claw towards your head.> "Hail fiend."The dragon's eyes widen when he sees you. He lets out a roar that shakes the ground and sends leaves flying everywhere. His body begins to glow red hot before it turns back to its normal color."I am glad to meet you, I know who you are."> "Then you know why I am here.""Yes, I do. You're the one who defeated the great beast called the Fire Dragon. It was you that saved me from certain death."

You're the one who defeated the great beast called the Fire Dragon. It was you that saved me from certain death."> "That is not why I am here. You have aggravated certain people enough to issue a quest for your demise.""Oh? And what would that be?"> "Did I not just say it? There is a quest issued to defeat you.""Ha ha! Well, that's certainly an interesting way of putting things. However, I'm sure if you were really serious about this quest, you'd have come by now."> Charge the dragon, sword in handYou rush forward, ready to strike. The dragon flies through the air and swings his claws at you. You dodge them both and follow up with a thrusting attack. The dragon tries to avoid your blade but he can't evade your speed either.> Stab the dragon in the heartWith a mighty stab, you sink your sword into the dragon's heart. Blood spurts out and the dragon falls dead to the floor."Well done!" A voice shouts.> "Who goes there?"
