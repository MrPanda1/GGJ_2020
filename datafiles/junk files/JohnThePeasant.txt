You are John, a peasant living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork and a nothing else. You wake up and begin working in the fields. You see a girl about your age named Eliza who is also working on the farm. She sees you and asks if you want to play tag with her.

> Stab her with my pitchfork

You grab your pitchfork and stab it into the ground. The girl screams as she falls to the ground. You look at her face and then back at your pitchfork. You pick up your shovel and walk over to Eliza, who is still lying on the ground crying.

> Help her up

You help Eliza up from the ground. "I'm sorry," you say. "It's just I've never seen anyone like you before."

> Join her in a game of tag

You both start playing tag. You keep throwing spears at each other until one of them falls off the edge of the cliff.

> Walk and see where the spear landed

You walk along the side of the cliff and see a spear landing near some rocks. You pick it up and examine it. It looks like an old one that has been broken in half.

> Repair the spear

You fix the spear back together and put it back in its place. You take it home with you. You tell everyone how great your new weapon is, but nobody seems to believe you.

> Run to my room and start crying

You rush to my room and start crying. Everyone thinks you're crazy for believing in God, so they don't believe you either.

> I perform an ancient ritual that summons god and destroys the tow

You go to my room and find a book of spells. You read through it carefully. You cast all the spells you can think of, but nothing happens. No lightning strikes or anything.

> You spend all night studying the spells

You spend the rest of the night studying the spells. You try to figure out what spell caused this to happen, but you can't remember any of it. Finally, you give up and fall asleep.

> I wake up and god stands before me

You awake and hear a voice calling to you. You look around and see a man dressed in black robes standing beside you. He smiles at you, but doesn't speak another word.

> You punch him in the face

You punch the man in the face. His head explodes into a million pieces, killing him instantly.

> Bring his body to Eliza

You carry his body to Eliza. She stares at it in shock, then she begins to weep. The tears flow freely down her cheeks as she holds the dead man's corpse in her arms.

> You ask her why is she crying, I am a hero

You ask her why she is crying, and she tells you that the man who killed him was a hero. A real hero.

> I tell the town of my mighty battle against the man

You tell the people of the town of your heroic victory over the man who killed their hero. They all cheer you on and call you "hero".

> I call Eliza up to marry her

You call Eliza up to marry her. She looks surprised by this request, but accepts.

> How does it end

The wedding takes place. You and Eliza live happily ever after...
