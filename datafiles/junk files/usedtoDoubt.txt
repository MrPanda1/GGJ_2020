I used to doubt you cared for me
When love was bright and blue.
We ran like puppies through a field,
But this I never knew.
We both said we were friends for life,
Not knowing what it meant,
Not knowing how to go through hell
And not somehow repent;

Not knowing love was something hard,
Like stone against the wind,
And life itself might be a prize
The heart would leave behind.

But now I know the depth of love,
And it was worth the pain,
Though not for love nor life would I
Go through that hell again!
