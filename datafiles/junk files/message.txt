
You are KitBag, a scavenger trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world by scavenging among the ruins of what is left. You have a rusty knife and a canteen. You walk for two hours and take a break. You've left your town in search of food. You look around and see that you're not far from civilization. You could easily find someplace to rest and eat.

But there's no place like home...

> sit under a tree

You decide to stay under a tree where you can get away from the sun. It would be nice if it didn't rain all day, but it seems like this will just be another long day. The sky is getting dark and soon night will fall.

> look for a place to sleep

You walk up to a nearby tree and sit down. You feel tired, so you go back to sleep. A few minutes later, you hear a noise behind you. You turn around and see a man standing over you with an axe in hand.

> "dont move"

You quickly stand up and raise your hands as high as you can before he swings his axe at them. He misses, but the pain is too much. You collapse on the ground and try to catch your breath.

> shank him

The next thing you know, you're lying on the ground and he's standing over you. He swings his axe again, but this time hits your head instead. You scream out in agony and fall unconscious.

> guess ill die

When you wake up, you're alone in the wasteland. You don't even remember how you got here or who you are.

> look around

You slowly stand up and look around. There's nothing around you except a barren landscape. You don't really have anything to wear either, so you make yourself comfortable until the sun comes up tomorrow.

> make myself comfortable?

You sit down and put your boots on while putting the canteen into your pocket. You then grab a piece of cloth and wrap it around your face to block the sun from burning you. After doing that, you begin to think about how lucky you are to be alive right now.

> try to find hot anime girls

You start looking around for any hot anime girls. You eventually come across one that looks pretty cute and you decide to talk to her. She says she doesn't speak English, but thanks you anyway.

> learn japanese

After talking to her for awhile, you realize that she has no idea what you're saying. So you ask her more questions in japanese which makes her laugh and tell you that she likes your accent.

> "no i like your accent"

You continue to talk to her, but she keeps getting annoyed with you. Eventually she tells you that she wants to leave since there isn't anything else interesting going on in the city.
