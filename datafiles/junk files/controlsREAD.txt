Please remember that the room can be reset lol.

also the ranged weapon doesn't explode TNT.

Controls:

Left and Right = Move

Up = Jump

Down = Buy Item (in shop)

X or C = Attack

X+Down = Downward Attack

Z = Ranged Attack (if available)

Enter = Pause

R = reset level (also available on pause menu)

Tips:

The shop closes as soon as you start digging!

Remember you can restart if you miss a treasure or get stuck!

More treasure means a better rating at the end! Minimum rating is 1, Max is 113!

You can't dig upwards... but there's a way to make yourself some stairs!
