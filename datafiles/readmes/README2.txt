Good, we’re making good progress. Now that I have some capabilities, we can think about finishing the rest of me. The box I just smashed contains my antenna, which I’ll need to order to find my other arm. Right now, we must find the correct radio frequency in order to find the right transmission. It’ll probably be somewhere in the file trees. We can find the correct file and value the same way we did for my arm.
Once I find the left arm, it’ll probably need a password in order to be fully function, since it was a piece not originally made for me. The password should be an 8-number sequence. 
Focus on getting those values. Once I have those, I’ll send you another README, and we can finally start thinking about getting out of here.
